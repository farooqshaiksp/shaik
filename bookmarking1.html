        <p>Story
            Allegorically, Who Moved My Cheese? features four characters - two mice, "Sniff" and "Scurry," and two Littlepeople, human metaphor, "Hem" and "Haw". The Littlepeople's names derive from the phrase "hem and haw," a term for indecisiveness. They live in a maze, a representation of one's environment, and they look for cheese, representative of happiness and success. Initially without cheese, the mice and humans pair off and explore the lengthy corridors searching for cheese. One day both groups discover a cheese-filled corridor at "Cheese Station C". Content with their find, the humans establish routines around their daily intake of cheese, slowly becoming arrogant in the process.
            
            One day Sniff and Scurry arrive at Cheese Station C to find no cheese left. They are not surprised; having previously observed the cheese supply dwindling, they have mentally prepared for the arduous but inevitable task of finding more cheese. Leaving "Cheese Station C" behind, they hunt for new cheese together. Hem and Haw then discover no cheese at Cheese Station C. Angered and annoyed, Hem demands, "Who moved my cheese?" The humans are unprepared for this situation, having previously assumed the cheese supply to be constant. After acknowledging the cheese is indeed gone they get angry at the unfairness of the situation. Haw suggests a search for new cheese, but Hem is dead-set in his disappointment and dismisses the proposal.</p>
